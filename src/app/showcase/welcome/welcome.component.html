    <h1 class="display-4 mb-4">ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Drux UI</h1>
  
    <p class="lead mb-6">
      Drux UI is a modern, thoughtfully-designed Angular component library powered by Bootstrap and class-variance-authority (CVA). It's built to help developers move fast without compromising on design quality or code structure.
    </p>
  
    <p class="lead mb-6">
      This is not just another UI kit. Drux UI gives you beautifully composable components with full control over styling and behavior, empowering you to craft consistent, elegant interfaces across your apps â€” with zero design bloat.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Why Drux UI?</h2>
    <ul class="list-unstyled text-left mx-auto mb-6">
      <li><strong>Composability:</strong> All components follow a predictable, composable pattern with CVA, giving you the flexibility to build and extend without friction.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimal by Design:</strong> Every component comes with a clean default style that's easy to customize, and never bloated with unnecessary variants or logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Bootstrap First:</strong> Built for Bootstrap from the ground up, Drux UI keeps your styling strategy consistent and utility-friendly.</li>
      <li><strong>Developer-Centric:</strong> Written with care for DX (developer experience). Simple imports, readable code, and no surprises.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2 class="h4 mb-4">Who made this?</h2>
